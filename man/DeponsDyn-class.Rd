\description{
Classes and methods for analyzing and plotting output from the
DEPONS model.
}
\details{
The following columns are included in the simulation output data
frame: 'tick', which indicates the number of half-hourly time steps since the
start of the simulation; 'count', which indicates the population size at a
given time; 'energy', showing the average amount of energy stored by simulated
animals; 'lenergy', which shows the total amount of energy in the landscape,
and 'real.time' which shows the time relative to 'startday'.
}

\describe{
\item{\code{title}}{Character. Name of the object or simulation}

\item{\code{landscape}}{Character. Identifier for the landscape used in the DEPONS
simulations. The landscapes 'DanTysk', 'Gemini', 'Kattegat', 'North Sea',
'Homogeneous', and 'User defined' are distributed with the DEPONS model.}

\item{\code{simtime}}{\code{\link{POSIXlt}} object with the date and time when the
simulation was finished. This is read from the name of the imput file.}

\item{\code{startday}}{POSIXlt object with the first day of the simulation, i.e.
the first day in the period that the simulations are intended to represent in
the real world.}

\item{\code{dyn}}{Data frame with simulation output.}
}}

\note{
DeponsDyn-objects are usually read in from csv files produced during
DEPONS simulations. These files are named 'Statistics.XXX.csv', where XXX
indicates the date and time when the simulation was finished.
